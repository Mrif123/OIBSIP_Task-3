# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

Designed a Machine Learning model to predict the selling price of the cars based on the features such as name of the car,year of manufacture,present price of the car,number of kilometers driven,fuel_type,selling_type and also on the basis of transmission and the number of previous owners using the two algorithms that are Linear Regression and Lasso Regression and also computed the r2 score of the two models for comparison between their metrics.

Then visualized the data with the tool that is Power BI for obtaining valuable insights about the data that is been visualized.

The report is then pinned to the dashboard and attached below is the glimpse of the dashboard:
